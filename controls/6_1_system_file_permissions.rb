  title 'Audit system file permissions'
  desc  "The RPM and Debian package manager have a number of useful options. One of these, the --verify (or -v for RPM) option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The --verify option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the meaning of output from the verify option: Code Meaning\nS File size differs.\nM File mode differs (includes permissions and file type).\n5 The MD5 checksum differs.\nD The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file.\nL A mismatch occurs in a link.\nU The file ownership differs.\nG The file group owner differs.\nT The file time (mtime) differs.\nThe rpm -qf or dpkg -S command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to. For example the following commands determines which package the /bin/bash file belongs to:\n# rpm -qf /bin/bash\nbash-4.1.2-29.el6.x86_64\n# dpkg -S /bin/bash\nbash: /bin/bash\nTo verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following:\n# rpm -V bash-4.1.2-29.el6.x86_64\n.M.......    /bin/bash\n# dpkg --verify bash\n??5?????? c /etc/bash.bashrc\nNote that you can feed the output of the rpm -qf command to the rpm -V command:\n# rpm -V `rpm -qf /etc/passwd`\n.M...... c /etc/passwd\nS.5....T c /etc/printcap\n\nRationale: It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor."
