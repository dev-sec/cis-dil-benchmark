  title 'Ensure IP forwarding is disabled'
  desc  "The net.ipv4.ip_forward flag is used to tell the system whether it can forward packets or not.\n\nRationale: Setting the flag to 0 ensures that a system with multiple interfaces (for example, a hard proxy), will never be able to forward packets, and therefore, never serve as a router."

  title 'Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled'
  desc  "ICMP Redirects are used to send routing information to other hosts. As a host itself does not act as a router (in a host only configuration), there is no need to send redirects.\n\nRationale: An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router devices in an attempt to corrupt routing and have users access a system set up by the attacker as opposed to a valid system."
