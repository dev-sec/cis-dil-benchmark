  title 'Ensure updates, patches, and additional security software are installed'
  desc  "Periodically patches are released for included software either due to security flaws or to include additional functionality.\n\nRationale: Newer patches may contain security enhancements that would not be available through the latest full update. As a result, it is recommended that the latest software patches be used to take advantage of the latest functionality. As with any software installation, organizations need to determine if a given update meets their requirements and verify the compatibility and supportability of any additional software against the update revision that is selected."
