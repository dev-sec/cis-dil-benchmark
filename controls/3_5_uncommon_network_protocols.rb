  title 'Ensure DCCP is disabled'
  desc  "The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport layer protocol that supports streaming media and telephony. DCCP provides a way to gain access to congestion control, without having to do it at the application layer, but does not provide in-sequence delivery.\n\nRationale: If the protocol is not required, it is recommended that the drivers not be installed to reduce the potential attack surface."

  title 'Ensure SCTP is disabled'
  desc  "The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer protocol used to support message oriented communication, with several streams of messages in one connection. It serves a similar function as TCP and UDP, incorporating features of both. It is message-oriented like UDP, and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like TCP.\n\nRationale: If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded, disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface."

It was developed by the Oracle Corporation.\n\nRationale: If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded, disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface."
