title '2.3 Service Clients'

control 'cis-dil-benchmark-2.3.1' do
  title 'Ensure NIS Client is not installed'
  desc  "The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages, is a client-server directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration files. The NIS client (ypbind) was used to bind a machine to an NIS server and receive the distributed configuration files.\n\nRationale: The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is recommended that the service be removed."

  title 'Ensure rsh client is not installed'
  desc  "The rsh package contains the client commands for the rsh services.\n\nRationale: These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with the more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed, it is best to ensure the clients are also removed to prevent users from inadvertently attempting to use these commands and therefore exposing their credentials. Note that removing the rsh package removes the clients for rsh, rcp and rlogin."

  title 'Ensure talk client is not installed'

The talk client, which allows initialization of talk sessions, is installed by default.\n\nRationale: The software presents a security risk as it uses unencrypted protocols for communication."

  title 'Ensure telnet client is not installed'
  desc  "The telnet package contains the telnet client, which allows users to start connections to other systems via the telnet protocol.\n\nRationale: The telnet protocol is insecure and unencrypted. The use of an unencrypted transmission medium could allow an unauthorized user to steal credentials. The ssh package provides an encrypted session and stronger security and is included in most Linux distributions."

It is a service that provides a method for looking up information from a central database.\n\nRationale: If the system will not need to act as an LDAP client, it is recommended that the software be removed to reduce the potential attack surface."
