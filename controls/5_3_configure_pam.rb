title '5.3 Configure PAM'

control 'cis-dil-benchmark-5.3.1' do # rubocop:disable Metrics/BlockLength
  title 'Ensure password creation requirements are configured'
  desc "The pam_cracklib.so module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of the pam_cracklib.so options.\n\n* try_first_pass - retrieve the password from a previous stacked PAM module. If not available, then prompt the user for a password.\n* retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.\n* minlen=14 - password must be 14 characters or more\n* dcredit=-1 - provide at least one digit\n* ucredit=-1 - provide at least one uppercase character\n* ocredit=-1 - provide at least one special character\n* lcredit=-1 - provide at least one lowercase character\n\nThe pam_pwquality.so module functions similarly but the minlen , dcredit , ucredit , ocredit , and lcredit parameters are stored in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file. The settings shown above are one possible policy. Alter these values to conform to your own organization's password policies.\n\nRationale: Strong passwords protect systems from being hacked through brute force methods."
